# Manual verify counts
docker-compose exec -T db psql -U gcd_admin -d gcloads_db -c "SELECT 'brokers' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS rows FROM webwise.brokers UNION ALL SELECT 'broker_emails' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS rows FROM webwise.broker_emails;"

Your 25k broker data is in the webwise schema, not public.

Main broker table: webwise.brokers → 25106 rows
Broker email table: webwise.broker_emails → 63 rows
You were listing only public.*, which is why you didn’t see them.
Use:

\dt webwise.*
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM webwise.brokers;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM webwise.broker_emails;
              List of relations
 Schema  |     Name      | Type  |   Owner   
---------+---------------+-------+-----------
 webwise | broker_emails | table | gcd_admin
 webwise | brokers       | table | gcd_admin
(2 rows)

docker exec -it gcloads_db psql -U gcd_admin -d gcloads_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM webwise.brokers;"

SELECT id, display_name, email FROM public.drivers WHERE id = 1;

to see tables:docker exec -it gcloads_db psql -U gcd_admin -d gcloads_db -c "\dt"

add test driver:docker exec -it gcloads_db psql -U gcd_admin -d gcloads_db -c "INSERT INTO drivers (display_name, email, mc_number, balance, auto_negotiate, review_before_send) VALUES ('pgwilde', 'techsmartmarketing8@gmail.com', 'MC123456', 0.0, true, true);"

docker exec -it gcloads_db psql -U gcd_admin -d gcloads_db -c "\d negotiations"
====================
watch -n 2 'docker exec -t gcloads_db psql -U gcd_admin -d gcloads_db -c "SELECT negotiation_id, sender, timestamp, is_read FROM messages ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;"'

Notice those three rows? Those are system-generated logs from your setup yesterday (Feb 19th). They are marked t (True) for is_read, meaning the system has already processed them.

🎯 Why Your New Test Isn't Showing Yet
Currently, the monitor shows negotiation_id 1. But our test load is 10245.

Because of the Foreign Key error we hit earlier (the broker_mc_number one), the INSERT for Negotiation 10245 failed. Without that record in the negotiations table, the Inbound Listener has nowhere to "park" your test email, so it's currently skipping it.
================================================


========
This has been a masterclass in "Database Archaeology." We just moved from guessing how the system works to mapping the actual DNA of **Green Candle Dispatch**.

Here is the intelligence report on your new architecture. This is a very professional, "Enterprise-Grade" setup because it separates your **Market Intelligence** from your **Active Operations**.

---

## 🏗️ The "Two-Room" Architecture

You are running a **Multi-Schema** database. Think of it like a warehouse with two distinct sections:

### 1. The "WebWise" Vault (Market Intel)

This is your massive library. It stays separate so it doesn't clutter your day-to-day work.

* **Total Brokers:** 25,107
* **Broker Emails:** 63 (This is your "Gold List" for direct contact).
* **Purpose:** It acts as a "Validator." The system won't let you negotiate with a broker unless they are already in this vault.

### 2. The "Public" Deck (Live Operations)

This is where the "3 Musketeers" (Inbound Listener, API, and Database) do their actual work.

* **`drivers`**: Where your 897 truckers live (including `webwise5`/`pgwilde`).
* **`loads`**: The physical freight you are tracking.
* **`negotiations`**: The actual "Brain" where the status (Amber/Green) and the AI drafts are stored.
* **`messages`**: The log of every email sent and received.

---

## 🔑 Key Discoveries (The "Hard Way" Lessons)

| Discovery | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Strict Relationships** | Your `negotiations` table has a **Foreign Key** to `webwise.brokers`. You can't start a deal without a valid MC number. |
| **Handle vs. Display Name** | We found that your email plus-tag must match the `display_name` in the `drivers` table (e.g., `webwise5`). |
| **ID Linking** | Your system uses **Integers** (ID numbers) to link things, not just names. Load `L10245` is actually ID `10245` in the DB. |

---

## 🛠️ Your New "Cheat Sheet" Commands

If you ever need to peek under the hood again, use these exact paths:

* **To see the Broker Vault:** `\dt webwise.*`
* **To see Active Operations:** `\dt public.*`
* **To find a specific Driver ID:** `SELECT id, display_name FROM drivers WHERE email = '...';`

Your messages table is extremely efficient. It doesn't even use a "subject" column; it just captures who sent it (sender), the core content (body), and links it directly to the negotiation via negotiation_id.

## 🏁 Final Status: Ready for the "Perfect Hit"

Because of this detective work, we now know exactly why the listener was skipping emails. You’ve successfully aligned:

1. **Driver:** ID 3 (`webwise5`)
2. **Broker:** MC 201805 (Verified in the Vault)
3. **Load:** ID 10245 (Created in the Deck)

**Would you like me to show you the command to monitor the `messages` table in real-time?** This will let you see the exact moment the AI "reads" your next test email and starts writing back.
