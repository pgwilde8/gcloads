🏦 Banking & Pay: The Green Candle FAQ
1. Will using Green Candle change how my factoring company (OTR, Triumph, etc.) pays me?
No. Your relationship with your factor stays exactly the same. When you win a load and upload your BOL through our Paperwork Terminal, your factor will send your funds to your existing bank account just like they always have. We do not touch your primary settlement.

2. Why do I need to connect a Stripe account?
Think of your Stripe account as your "Automation Fuel Wallet." It serves two specific purposes:

$CANDLE Rewards: This is where your 21% "Paperwork Refill" rewards are tracked and stored.

Automation Fees: It handles the small fees (e.g., 0.3 $C) for 1-Click Dispatching and sending packets, so you don't have to manually pay an invoice every time you book a load.

3. Is my "Main Bank" and my "Green Candle Wallet" the same thing?
No. They are separate.

Main Bank: Where your big checks go (from OTR/Brokers).

Green Candle Wallet (Stripe): Where your automation rewards live and where your AI tools are powered. It's like having a dedicated "Fuel Card" for your business software.

4. Does the broker or factoring company see my Stripe info?
Never. They only see your professional @gcdloads.com identity and your legal documents (MC/COI/W9). Your Stripe account is private and only used to power the Green Candle tools on your dashboard.

5. What if I want to move my $CANDLE rewards to my main bank?
Once you reach a certain threshold, you can "Off-Ramp" your rewards through Stripe Connect directly into your linked bank account.
